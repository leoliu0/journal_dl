An easy way to download Economics and Finance papers

Usage:
```bash
python3 JF.py 2018
```
to download all papers in journal of finance of year 2018. You can only download year by year. 
I do so because I don't want you to download too much a single time, otherwise your school account may be suspended.
You also need to have JF subscription to wiley. Otherwise it will fail.
